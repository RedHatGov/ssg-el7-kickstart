ABOUT
=====

THIS CONFIGURATION CURRENTLY BETA - RHEL 7.2 should have the offical Common
Criteria evaluation and FIPS 140-2 certification. Right now, only the minimal
installation profile is configured. Additional profiles will be added shortly.

Modifies a RHEL 7.1+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured and hardened for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. 

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects 
into a single installer:

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying graphical classification banner)
   
        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark and hardening scripts for the 
     system after installation
   
        https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide

HARDENING INFORMATION
=====================

Here is some additional information added by the supplemental hardening script
in addition to the SSG:

1. The kernel option for  FIPS 140-2 mode is contained on the kickstart menu

2. Shell timeout (bash/csh) is 15 minutes of inactivity, vlock will lock CLI
   console

3. The 'wheel' group is required for privleged users (beyond root) to run 
   `su -` or `sudo -i` commands, sudo timeout is 5 minutes

4. The 'sshusers' group is required for SSH/SFTP access, other users are 
   limited to console access without this group
   
5. Runlevel 3 is configured by default to meet requirements, run the following
   for an X Windows session:
   
   	$ startx

6. Additional Software such as McAfee EPo/HBSS may be required meet site 
   policy

7. Configure NTP (/etc/ntp.conf) and rsyslog logging to remote server 
   (/etc/rsyslog.conf)

8. Create users:

        Local Console Access Only (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Local User" localuser
               
        Remote Access (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Remote User" -G sshusers remoteuser
               
        System Administrator (SA) (Privileged User)
               
               # useradd -m -c "System Administrator" -G sshusers,wheel admin
               
        (Optional) After adding SAs to the system, lock the root account:
          
               # passwd -l root
